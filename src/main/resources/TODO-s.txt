/*TODO problems in project
0) Caching by dictionary + add dictionary for minicard and cache it as well as all dictionaries
0*) After caching we can no more hold words in table for each concrete user -- just hold a reference in DB
2) JSP -> thymeleaf (or even react or angular for front)
6) js looks very trashy at the time, mb switch for some front - end framework
9) transactional in dao tests are not working so I did transactional in dao layer instead of service
15) Test what will happen if user not in DB in authentication time
18) spellchecker TranslationFromApiController : if word isn't correct guess what user wanted to add + Some normal way to show error (not one currently used)
19) ComprehensiveTranslationServiceLingvo makeWordValidForApi() throws to apiEntity just 1 word, need some normal logic here
29) Add Liquidbase to project.
33) Validator
34) Optionals in repository methods!!!
36) Message if password wrong
38) edit form button.
43) https://developers.lingvolive.com/ru-ru/Help Suggests
44) Migrate to Junit5 and mockito 3
45) Interest and Dictionary repositories
46) Should rebuild SuggestedTranslationService - it now takes 5 biggest words, should take 5 less known ones
47) path to file is broken now

50) ??? Move rest calls to dao layer ???
