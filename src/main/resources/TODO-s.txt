/*TODO problems in project
0) Caching by dictionary + add dictionary for minicard and cache it as well as all dictionaries
0*) After caching we can no more hold words in table for each concrete user -- just hold a reference in DB
2) JSP -> thymeleaf (or even react or angular for front)
6) js looks very trashy at the time, mb switch for some front - end framework
15) Test what will happen if user not in DB in authentication time
18) spellchecker TranslationFromApiController : if word isn't correct guess what user wanted to add + Some normal way to show error (not one currently used)
19) ComprehensiveTranslationServiceLingvo takes just 1 word
33) Validator
36) Message if password wrong
38) edit form button.
43) https://developers.lingvolive.com/ru-ru/Help Suggests
46) Should rebuild SuggestedTranslationService - it now takes 5 biggest words, should take 5 less known ones
* Rebuild tests - delete SpringBootTest on Unit tests and separate configs
* Api calls back to intellij ???
* Inject session scope user to controller
* Controller tests via Spring boot
