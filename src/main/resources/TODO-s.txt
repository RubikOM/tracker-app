TODO problems in project
0) Caching by dictionary + add dictionary for minicard and cache it as well as all dictionaries
0*) After caching we can no more hold words in table for each concrete user -- just hold a reference in DB
18) spellchecker TranslationFromApiController : if word isn't correct guess what user wanted to add + Some normal way to show error (not one currently used)
33) Validator
36) Validation for landing page (password wrong)
38) make edit button workable
43) https://developers.lingvolive.com/ru-ru/Help Suggests for concrete word - can make suggestions for non correct words (low priority)
